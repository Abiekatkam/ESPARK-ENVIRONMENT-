      <p class="paragraph_dark">
        The hydrosphere is the total quantity of water on a planet. It includes
        water on the planet’s surface, underground, and in the atmosphere. The
        hydrosphere of a planet might be liquid, vapour, or ice.

      <h2 class="headline_dark">Why is the Hydrosphere Important?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph_dark">
        We rarely think about the role of the planet that keeps us alive and
        take the hydrosphere for granted. The major importance of the
        hydrosphere is that water sustains various life forms and plays an
        important role in ecosystems and regulating the atmosphere. Hydrosphere
        covers all water present on the Earth’s surface. It involves saltwater,
        freshwater, and frozen water, along with groundwater and water in the
        lower levels of the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <ul class="listed_order">
        <li>
          Water is the most important part of living cells Every cell in a
          living organism is built up of about 75% of water, hence allowing the
          cell to function appropriately. Cells would not be able to carry out
          normal functions and life cannot exist without water.
          </li>

          <li>
            Human needs
          Humans use water in many ways. Drinking water is the most obvious use,
          but it is also used for domestic purposes like washing and cleaning
          and in industries. Water is also utilised in generating electricity
          through hydropower.
          </li>

          <li>
            Water provides habitat Hydrosphere provides a place for many plants and animals to live in. Many gasses like CO2,
            O2, nutrients like ammonium and nitrite(NO–2) as well as other ions
            are dissolved in water. The presence of these substances is essential
            for life to exist in water.
          </li>

          <li>
            Regulate Climate The water’s specific
            heat is its unique characteristic. This indicates that water takes a
            lot of time to heat up and a lot of time to cool down. It helps in
            regulating temperatures on earth as they stay in a range that is
            acceptable for life on earth to exist. These are only a few of the
            functions that water plays on the planet. Many functions relate it to
            chemistry and methods in which it dissolves substances.

            <p class="paragraph_light">
              One of the most efficient ways of lowering your environmental
              impact is by travelling responsibly. This means, whenever you can,
              choosing a more sustainable way to get from A to B - walk or cycle
              when you can. Transport is one of the most polluting sectors. But
              holidaying closer to home can make a big impact on your carbon
              footprint. One short haul return flight can account for 10% of
              your yearly carbon emissions, and long-haul flights can completely
              determine your carbon impact. If you have the time you can usually
              get trains to destinations to cut your carbon footprint. Get
              creative and try to find alternate ways to travel.

            <h2 class="headline_light">eat sustainably:</h2>
            <p class="paragraph_light">
              Food production is a major driver of wildlife extinction. What we
              eat contributes around a quarter of global greenhouse gas
              emissions and is responsible for almost 60% of global biodiversity
              loss. Farming animals for meat and dairy requires space and huge
              inputs of water and feed. Today, one of the biggest causes of
              forest loss is the expansion of agricultural land for animal feed
              production, such as soy. And producing meat creates vastly more
              carbon dioxide than plants such as vegetables, grains and legumes.
              Moving away from a meat-dominated diet towards a more plant-based
              diet can lower your impact on the environment. Vegetarian and
              vegan foods are massively on the rise and becoming far more common
              in restaurants, cafes and supermarkets, so you’ll rarely struggle.
              Not only that, but cutting down on meat and dairy products can
              reduce your weekly food bills.

              We need to make wasting our resources unacceptable in all aspects
              of our life. Every product we buy has an environmental footprint
              and could end up in landfill. The impact of plastic pollution on
              our oceans is becoming increasingly clear, having drastic impacts
              on marine life. Recycling what we can reduces the amount of new
              materials we are making, and upcycling is a creative way to make
              old items into something more valuable. This could be reusing a
              jam jar as a candle holder, or using old tins as plant pots – the
              possibilities are endless! It’s not just the products we buy. It’s
              estimated that a third of all food produced in the world is lost
              or wasted. Do your bit by eating up leftovers and use any
              ingredients you have spare to make interesting meals. Try to waste
              as little food as possible, and compost the organic waste you
              can’t eat.
